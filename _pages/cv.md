* B.A. in Computer Science, Emory University, 2022

Honors
======
* MCM Meritorious Winner (2021)
* Honors Program Student (2021)
* Honor List (2018-2020)
* Dean’s List (2019)


Work experience
======
* Summer 2021: Data Analyst/Data Operation Intern
  * Bytedance Ltd, Shenzhen, China
  * Evaluated matching algorithms used in POI data deduplication and optimized it with a 20% increase in recall rate
  * Performed POI data cleaning, data labeling, and evaluated data quality on a regular basis
  * Undertook an in-depth analysis of data from POI user feedback and Merchant Settle-In functionalities of the TikTok app, helping to improve the quality of POI data and upgrade the existing database
  * Worked closely with R&D and PM teams to adjust product-side development roadmap and helped in testing and tracking bugs
  * Implemented mechanisms to automate data management workflows at end-to-end, enhancing the efficiency of data operation and reducing manual workload

* Fall 2019: Tutor
  * Math Center of Emory University, Oxford, GA
  * Tutored an average of 6+ students in walk-in sessions and 3+ students in private sessions weekly and provided customized study guides, achieving 10-15% improvement in test scores
  * Worked closely with professors to regularly update the individual student’s progress and grades 
  * Organized monthly mock tests and review sessions to 60+ students and graded the exams with constructive feedbacks
  * Increased the number of visiting students by 30% through targeted advertising, including sending emails to math students individually and distributing leaflets

Research Experience
======
* Numerical Methods for Neural-Network-based Solution of High-dimensional Optimal Control Problems 
  * Associate Professor, Lars Ruthotto, Emory University, ATL, GA
  * Implemented variance reduction methods including SAG, SAGA, SVRG, and SSVRG optimizers in Pytorch
  * Applied variance reduction optimizers and the stochastic Newton method to train the neural-network-based model for solving high-dimensional optimal control problems and compare their effectiveness
  * Fine-tuned the hyperparameters and conducted experiments to exploit that SSVRG converges faster with five to ten times fewer gradient counts than ADAM, effectively reducing the training cost of high-dimensional neural networks
  * Currently writing a thesis with 30+ pages and preparing for its defense in March 2022

* Estimating the COVID-19 Infection Rate by Causal Inference
  * Associate Professor, Adam Glynn, Emory University, Altanta GA
  * Collected and cleaned 20+ datasets from Emory COVID-19 Dashboard and Georgia Department of Public Health
  * Generalized the partial identification and monotonicity assumptions to bound the asymptomatic infection rate and population infection rate for the Emory community
  * Established the baseline asymptomatic infection rate for Emory through February 2021, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4
  
Project Experience
=====
* Mobile App Development Event Finder
  * Worked in a team of 7 to design a social application for foreigners and immigrants to collect and share information about cultural events
  * Used SwiftUI and Xcode to implement frontend pages, including the home page, profile page, post-event page, change preference page, search & filter functionalities, etc.
  * Set up the Django backend framework, designed Event & User models, and implemented the restful APIs with API filters
  * Deployed the backend using Nginx and Gunicorn on VPS, integrated the backend and frontend through restful APIs, and released a completely functional iOS app to Testflight in the Apple Store 

* Predicting Cryptocurrency Prices Using Machine Learning
  * Combined LSTM, CNN, and random-forest as ensemble models to predict cryptocurrency prices at the minute level and compare their performances
  * Applied sliding window algorithm to time-series data and performed feature scaling and feature expansion, including rolling window features, return value, lags, etc.
  * Performed holdout-validation to select the best hybrid model, and the results showed that CNN-LSTM produced the most stable predictions, outperforming the baseline model LSTM by 40%

* Detecting Vespa Mandarinia Among Hornets
  * Constructed the time-series based Grey Markov Model GM(1, 1) to predict the spread of Vespa mandarinia and generated random noise to improve the model predictability
  * Developed Natural Language Processing model based on word embedding, TF-IDF statistics measure, and SVC machine learning algorithm, to predict the classification of different hornets
  * Used easy data augmentation and back-translation to overcome the classification imbalance
  * Achieved 96.9% accuracy and 85.3% True Positive Rate at 14.6% Misclassification Rate

* Mobile App Helping People Safely Back to School and Work
  * Worked in a team of 3 to design a social application that encourages people to keep physical distance while maintaining weak social interaction during COVID-19
  * Utilized Figma to practice prototyping from scratch with the Minimalism design style
  * Made a 10-minute video to demonstrate the prototype and business plan and publicized it on Youtube
  * Applied for $4,000 through the CREATE-X Startup program of Georgia Tech to launch the project from idea stage into fully functioning and viable startups

* COVID-19 Death Rate by Multiple Factors in the United States
  * Collaborated with five members to collect 5+ million data from CDC official websits
  * Used R packages to analyze the correlation between COVID-19 death rate and sex, race, age, and create 10+ plots
  * Created an HTML report to summarize the project analysis and provide suggestions, and presented to 100+ classmates

* Inequality among School Dropouts
  * Applied Bayes' Theorem and Binomial Model to analyze the inequality of dropout rate among adolescence by ethnicity, age, and sex
  * Built expected value model to measure the magnitude of inequality of school dropouts at the social level
  * Visualized data in R and wrote 4+ separate reports to demonstrate the project progress and results
