About Me
======
Hi! I am Yujan, a senior student at Emory University double majoring in Applied Mathematics & Statistics and Computer Science. I came from Taiwan and grew up in the mainland of China. I have spent great years studying at Emory! Since I entered Emory, I have been having many thoughts about life, and I've found out my great passions in mathematics and data science. I am currently doing an honor program under the supervising of Professor Ruthotto at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Emory University. My primary interest is in deep learning, especially the optimization for high-dimensional optimal control problems. My current research focuses on applying the variance-reduced methods and approaches for high-dimensional optimal control problems based on neural networks. I am also interested in NLP, and I love this field because it combines many different fields, such as data collection, sentiment analysis, programming, and algorithm development.



Career Goal
======


I hope to work as a professional data analyst with a data-driven mindset and continue my research with great passion, putting the technical skills into practice and acquiring industry experience. In the long run, I aspire to be a machine learning engineer and focus on algorithm designing to contribute significantly to the global data science community. I look forward to opportunities that will allow me to excel in this field, and I am motivated by challenges and always want to learn more about new topics in machine learning and data science.
