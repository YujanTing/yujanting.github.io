Summary
======


The long short-term memory (LSTM) network is a state-of-the-art model for time series forecasting like stock or cryptocurrency markets. However, less study has been made on the minute-level pre- diction of cryptocurrency markets. We proposed three different models, LSTM, stacked LSTM, and CNN-LSTM, to forecast the closing price of cryptocurrency based on a small amount of previous se- quential data. We trained our models on minute bitcoin price from 2019/4/1 to 2019/5/2. The proposed CNN-LSTM outperformed other models under different evaluation indicators such as mean squared error (MSE), root means squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). We also explained why CNN-LSTM was better than others in minute-level prediction. The study reveals the possibility of automatic transaction robots in the Bitcoin market.
